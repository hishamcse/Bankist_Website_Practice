# Bankist_Website_Practice
 
A simple website practicing various effects/functionalities implemented in javascript in a webpage.<br />
Implemented Functionalities in javascript:

   1. Modal Window
   2. Smooth Scrolling
   3. Page Navigation
   4. Tabbed Component
   5. Menu Fade Animation
   6. Sticky Navigation
   7. Revealing Elements on scroll
   8. Lazy Loading Images
   9. Slider Component
 
  N.B: Bank page functionality is same as my other repository (Simple_Bankist_App)<br />
       &nbsp; Account can't be created. It is just for modal window practice<br />
